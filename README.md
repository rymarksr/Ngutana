# Ngutana
Ngutana is a Cebuano term for asked. It is your virtual assistant, where you can enter a specific topic or a  technical computation that gives you the answer by utilizing the Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha libraries or using its API as an option. I put text-to-speech features using the pyttsx3 library to make this little project more interactive.
